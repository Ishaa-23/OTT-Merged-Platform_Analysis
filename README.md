# Problem Statement
Lio, a leading telecommunications provider in India, is planning a strategic merger with Jotstar, one of the countryâ€™s most prominent streaming platforms. This potential partnership aims to combine LioCinemaâ€™s expansive subscriber base and Jotstarâ€™s diverse content library to revolutionize digital streaming in India. As part of the merger preparation, the management team at Lio wants to analyse the performance and user behavior of both platformsâ€”LioCinema and Jotstarâ€”over the past one year (January to November 2024). The goal is to gain insights into individual platform performance, content consumption patterns, subscriber growth, Inactivity behavior, upgrade and downgrade trends. The insights derived from this study will help the management make informed decisions and optimize content strategies post-merger, with the ultimate goal of establishing Lio-Jotstar as the leading OTT platform in India.  Peter Pandey is the data analyst at Lio, and he is tasked to analyse the data and provide insights.

* Launch a brand campaign under the theme **"Best of Both Worlds,"** showcasing the strengths of both OTT platformsâ€”more content, diverse genres, and a lower subscription price. Highlight the benefits of the merger through engaging storytelling and influencer collaborations with youth-favorite celebs. To drive new signups, offer a **10% discount** with a **NEW USER** promo code, making the platform even more appealing to first-time users.
* Introduce bundled offers (monthly/annual) at lower costs to attract users. Launch **mobile-only plans** with exclusive discounts. For premium members, offer perks like 1-month free subscription to encourage frequent upgrades.
* Partner with telecom companies to **preinstall the app** on smartphones, increasing visibility. Offer **free trials or discounts** as part of telecom reward programs to attract new users.
* Integrate machine learning algorithms to analyze user preferences and provide personalized content recommendations. Utilize AI-driven ratings based on user feedback to enhance content discovery and help other users find highly-rated shows and movies.
* Leverage celebrities who have transitioned careers to represent a diverse audience and build brand identity. Figures like MS Dhoni, Virat Kohli, and Deepika Padukone bring credibility, wide reach, and strong digital presence, making them ideal for marketing campaigns.
